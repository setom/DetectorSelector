The system is ruggedized and suitable for on scene and site monitoring by first responders, commercial security providers, and the military. With minimal training, ABSS allows the operator to rapidly detect and identify biological materials. The sensing components of ABSS have been partitioned into three physical packages: an intelligent collector module, a manual identification module, and an electronics module. The intelligent collector continuously samples the air, searching for the presence of biological compounds. Upon detection of a biological event, the collector warns, notifies and performs an automatic sample collection. Modules can utilize advanced detection algorithms and be networked for enhanced performance. The manual identification module provides the sample preparation and identification capabilities needed to identify potential threat material. Identification is achieved by utilizing industry leading polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunoassay technologies with options for automated and guided manual sample preparation. The electronics module utilizes CDS's ATHINA to provide power management, operator interface, and networking infrastructure to operate the system. This module enables the system to be configured for task-specific requirements by simply changing the sensing modules. No changes to the operator interface or software are needed.",

ALL's digital microfluidic systems shatter this traditional one device-one workflow paradigm. Within the ALL cartridge, electrode arrays are arranged on inexpensive printed circuit boards (PCBs). An injection molded plastic plate above the PCB creates a chamber where droplets are manipulated.

        "techDescription": "After extraction of nucleic acids from samples of interest, the MassCode PCR workflow starts with Reverse Transcription PCR (RT-PCR) on the source material in 96-well plate format. PCR primers for each target are designed to minimize primer-dimer formation and to be specific for a set of inclusive sequences, e.g. multiple viral nucleic acid targets, while being exclusive for non-desired sequences, such as all other targets in the reaction and potential contaminating sequences. Each forward and reverse primer is conjugated with a small molecule tag of a specific mass to provide a dual signal for a given target sequence. After RT-PCR, the reaction is subjected to selective depletion of excess primers and unwanted side reactions. The entire 96-well plate is then loaded into the LC autosampler for automated processing through an ultra violet (UV) unit which cleaves the small molecule tags from the amplifi ed target. Subsequent flow injection into the single quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization (APCI) source enables detection of the respective tags. MassCode PCR Application Software automatically analyses the data and reports results for each target of interest."

        "Description": "The AIR System performs extremely sensitive label-free, multianalyte immunoassays (64 to several hundred array elements) on a silicon chip mounted in an injection-molded disposable cartridge. Protein assays typically have 1 pg/ml sensitivity, and a 5 to 6 log detection range. Assay protocols are completely automated and fluidic operations are controlled by an on-board microprocessor. These protocols primarily consist of incubation, wash and optical read-out steps that may be conveniently modified for specific applications or conditions using Windows software. All sample and wash fluids are stored onboard the cartridge after an assay is completed- there is no possibility of post-analysis sample contact. The hardware is currently in its fourth generation. The AIR platform is highly amendable to multiplexing, allowing for rapid, simultaneous quantification of potentially 100’s of analytes with no increase in assay complexity. This robust detection platform is novel in its combination of rapid testing, highly multiplexed capacity and low assay cost. AIR has also been adapted for use in the field and at the point of need.",
        "techDescription": "AIR is a silicon chip-based label-free biosensor platform, which enables the detection and quantification of virtually any probe-target analyte pair with a high degree of sensitivity. Detection occurs via optical sensing of the binding of sub-Angstrom layers to the functionalized substrate surface. As AIR is an essentially reagentless assay, typical target analysis takes under 30 minutes of processing time (limited only by binding kinetics of the probe-target), in contrast to labeled techniques, which require further processing (usually 2-3 additional chemistries after target hybridization) and result in longer test times (>2 hrs) and substantially increased reagent costs."

The LIF detector continuously analyzes air samples for airborne pathogens. It statistically correlates particle size and florescence comparing samples to statistically known signatures of dangerous pathogens. If it finds a match, it triggers real-time collection of the airborne particulates into a saline solution. The AiroCollect-Detect is easy to operate and designed in modular fashion, so it can be easily packaged into larger systems. Alternatively, it can be environmentally enclosed and temperature regulated to operate standalone.",
        "techDescription": "The WWPC Collector uses inertial aerodynamic separation of bio-aerosols particulates in the human aspiration size range. Particles larger than 10 microns are removed using a pre-separator and inlet. Particles smaller than ½ micron escape the cyclonic force. The walls of the cyclone are wetted to achieve high collection efficiencies and concentration factors. The LIF Detector operates on the principle of Mie scattering, concurrently examining each particle for the presence of the metabolites NADH and riboflavin. The detector simultaneously measures particle size and florescence with a single illumination. It processes the two signals and compares results to known biological signatures."

It is an integration of Research International's proven SASS 2300 air sampler technology and RAPTOR four-channel bioassay system. ASAP II may be provided with a small fixed-installation environmental enclosure that maximizes reagent life and unattended monitoring time, or in component form for minimum weight and volume. Both may be operated minimally trained personnel. In operation, the SASS 2300 samples air continuously and transfers particulates into a secondary water phase of about 4 to 5 ml volume. These water samples are periodically transferred from the SASS 2300 to the RAPTOR. One mL is used for analysis and the remainder is saved as a confirmatory sample. The RAPTOR then automatically performs a multi-step 'sandwich format' fluoroimmunoassay for up to four agents on the liquid sample using a disposable assay coupon. Each of these 4-channel assay coupons may be reused up to 30 times over a 48-hour unattended operating period before replacement of the coupon and related reagents is necessary providing extremely competitive per-assay costs. The fixed-installation system, which has found particular application in mailrooms, includes 5-day fluid reservoirs, yet weighs only 80 pounds and consumes an average power of 30 watts. A remote PC allows operating personnel to monitor the system, while an optional green/amber safety light immediately communicates system status to nearby workers.",

In operation, the SASS 2300 samples air continuously and transfers particulates into a secondary water phase of about 4 to 5 ml volume. Transfer of the sample from the SASS to the Raptor is fully automated as are analyses, based on 'sandwich format' fluoroimmunoassays taking place on the surface of injection molded polystyrene waveguides. The waveguide has a monolayer of capture antibody immobilized on its surface. It is incubated with sample, washed, then incubated with fluorophore-labeled antibody to form an antibody/antigen/labeled-antibody sandwich. Excitation light is injected into and fluorescence emission is collected from the waveguide."

It allows users to select which threats are monitored for, and to implement only those features currently needed. In many cases the systems can be upgraded to include additional monitoring capabilities as the threat situation changes or as additional funds become available. Current ASAP V capabilities include: biodetection, bio-identification, chemical and explosives detection, radiation detection/identification and visual detection (visible or thermal IR imaging) Each separate threat detection device is coupled to the monitored space and to a host industrial computer built into the ASAP V. The detectors used for each threat are selected from the best technologies available on the world market. The outputs from all detectors are merged into one monitoring program. This allows implementation of sophisticated situation responses that are based on all the detector outputs. For example, if a sudden increase in the biological aerosol level is detected, the software can turn on an aerosol sampler to gather a sample for later analysis, or a bio-identifier to perform an immediate bio-analysis. The dedicated computer makes possible the implementation of a wide range of digital communication links with external monitoring sites. For example, it is possible to monitor and control the ASAP V from a remote location and provide a level of interaction that is identical to being at the equipment location.",
        "techDescription": "Airborne samples are collected using a built-in air handler that incorporates a computer-controlled centrifugal blower capable of cycling air at a maximum rate of 20,000 liters/minute and at a maximum pressure drop of 0.5 meters of water static head. Individual detectors take air from this primary sampling stream at their specific sampling rates. The ASAP V currently uses an OEM version of Environic’s IMS-based ChemProFX for detecting toxic chemicals and chemical warfare agents. Several libraries of targeted gases and vapors are available. Explosives detection is provided by an OEM version of Safran’s IMS-based MobilTrace™. The ASAP V uses Research International’s TacBio™ ultraviolet-based biological aerosol detector to monitor for unusual changes in bio-aerosol levels. Aerosol samples are collected for later analysis using RI’s SASS 4100 two-stage high volume aerosol sampler and its high efficiency electret filters. Identification of biological threats may be done using Alexeter Technologies bioassay strips or alternatively, identification may be performed on-line using either RI’s RAPTOR or BioHawk automated bio-identifiers. RI has formed a strategic partnership with the Scientific Production Center ASPECT in Dubna, Russia to provide radiation detection equipment. This equipment is usually in the form of a portal monitor that detects radioactive materials being transported by individuals. As such, the detector is mounted outside the ASAP V shell. There are a number of video suppliers and RI will work with specific customers to accommodate their video needs. For thermal imaging, RI prefers to use the Chinese company, Zhejiang ULIRvision Technology Co., Ltd."

The instrument can be located in either a conventional laboratory or transported in a mobile laboratory environment, with no reduction in performance. BenchTOF-dx is GC platform neutral i.e. it can interfaced with most commercially available GC systems and associated sample introduction techniques eg thermal desorption, liquid injection, headspace, SPME etc. GC control and data analysis uses existing vendor software which provides a rapid mechanism for learning and using the instrument, alternatively proprietary data analysis software (MOSAIG) is available from ALMSCO International. BenchTOF-dx is currently being used in a broad range of applications e.g. CWA, environmental, explosives, toxicology, oil exploration and research, metabolomics and food safety.",
        "techDescription": "Within the remit of CBRN analysis, the BenchTOF-dx MS detector is designed specifically for the analysis of CWA compounds. However this has also extended to some “e” type (explosive) compounds. BenchTOF-dx is a reflectron based TOF instrument which incorporates innovative design features, it was designed from first principles i.e. it is not a revamped product. The TOF detection technology is based on the flight time of charged ions derived from electron ionisation of compounds within an ion source. This time interval accurately identifies the mass of all the ions generated for a compound and ultimately creates a spectrum. The Ionisation energy is a variable but typically this is maintained at 70 eV. By careful design of the ion optics, flight tube and detector, spectra created by BenchTOF-dx have a classical profile i.e. they are directly compatible with the NIST and other commercially available databases. This allows conventional identification of both target and unknown compounds at trace levels using well known MS libraries. The ionisation technique is based on direct extraction in which both ionisation and extraction down the flight tube occur within the same ion source volume. This approach minimises ion loss experienced by orthoganol type TOF systems and contributes to the sensitivity. Resolution is not compromised using this approach, the BenchTOF resolution is sub unit mass and sufficient to exclude matrix effects and chemical noise, allowing selectivity for analytes of known exact mass. System sensitivity with full spectrum data is equivalent to Selected Ion Monitoring (SIM) using quadrupole detection."

The biodetector portion of the instrument will also accept fluids for analysis from other sample collection systems, or will process liquid samples loaded into the instrument manually. Bioassays are performed within a small disposable credit card-sized plastic assay coupon that may be used for up to 10 assay procedures before being discarded.

These water samples are periodically transferred from the air sampler to the bio-identifier. The sample is used for analysis and then may be saved as a confirmatory sample. <br />The BioHawk then automatically performs a multi-step 'sandwich format' fluoroimmunoassay for up to eight agents on the liquid sample using a disposable assay coupon. Each of these 8-channel assay coupons may be reused up to 10 times before replacement of the coupon is necessary providing extremely competitive per-assay costs. Assays are based on 'sandwich format' fluoroimmunoassay reactions taking place on the surface of injection molded polystyrene waveguides. All fluidic and optoelectronic steps associated with the assay are performed automatically. In a typical waveguide-based sandwich immunoassay, the waveguide has a monolayer of capture antibody immobilized on its surface. The waveguide is first incubated with sample, washed, then incubated with fluorophore-labeled antibody to form an antibody/antigen/labeled-antibody sandwich. Excitation light is injected into the waveguide and fluorescence emission is collected by a sensitive photodetector that looks at the waveguide surface."

Threat chemicals include TIC’s, CWA’s, explosives and narcotics. Mutli-species detection, identification and quantification can be done at very low concentrations (single-figure ppb) which when combined with the sensors high volume sampling rate (>100 litres/min) make the unit ideal for mobile search and on ‘on the move’ applications. Tangible user benefits include; more rapid incident response; significantly reduced search times; and covert chemical surveillance by detecting trace levels of raw products and by-products from illicit manufacturing processes.",

Ultra-Violet spectroscopy is an area largely overlooked in recent decades but modern techniques and a new approach have yielded exciting results. The species enter the system through a high-capacity air inlet to an optical cell where the sample is analyzed. The sensor is able to recognize the chemical compounds in the air, untangle them and quantify their presence in real time (<1 sec). The use of differentials rather than pure absorption allows simultaneous detection of multiple species, avoiding the usual masking."

The key components are a pre-concentrator (PC), a micro gas chromatograph (GC) column (2.5 meters), and a pair of Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) micro balance detectors. <br />The CANARY-3TM instrument captures a gas sample in the PC, a chemically-selective porous media, and then thermally desorbs the sample in a sharp, concentrated pulse. A sample enters the GC in a sharp pulse, and then separates into individual constituents as a result of interactions with a coating. The time between sample injection and emergence of the constituents from the column is used to identify the analyte. The measured weight of the sample is related to the concentration of the analyte in the gas sample. The Canary-3 offers “Smart Sampling” which incorporates dual detectors. This allows the instrument to provide a much greater dynamic range of analysis. The instrument includes a display that provides real time information on instrument activities, analyte identification and concentration. "

In its SPR mode it provides capabilities equal to or superior to competing SPR instruments, offering highly multiplexed measurements of high molecular weight analytes in real time. The SPCE mode produces highly directional fluorescence enabling detection in the femptomolar range. The dual-mode instrument is specifically designed to chemically capture (using antibodies, aptamers) and quantify the pattern of cytokines secreted.",
        "techDescription": "The instrument combines Grating-coupled Surface Plasmon Resonance and Surface Plasmon Coupled Emission functionality into one instrument. Detection of all analytes present in a single sample occurs simultaneously. The specificity depends on antibody or aptamer selection and binding. Detection depends on the mass of analyte captured or an enhanced fluorescence signal."

        "Description": "Resonant Sensors Incorporated (RSI) is developing a new compact photonic biosensor system for real time screening of an array of biotoxins, parasites and/or viruses in biological and environmental samples. Our products include a disposable sensor chip with an associated compact reader unit that can rapidly and simultaneously screen for an array of agents without requiring the use of chemical labels or post processing steps. This differentiating technology provides a new point-of-use diagnostic tool for first responders in the field. Our sensor platform can be applied to monitor an array of bio- or chemical reactions in a variety of matrices (including serum, environmental water samples, and food). Selectivity is imparted on the sensor element using conventional surface chemistries (such as silane) to covalently attach commercially available antibody, aptamer, or DNA layers. As a test begins, the analyte binds to the detection-layer target, and the system monitors instantaneous changes at the sensor surface, thus providing real-time data. Test time is limited only by chemical binding dynamics, and is typically less than 10-15 minutes. Qualitative data is available immediately after sample introduction. The RSI sensor chips are pre-sensitized to detect a target panel of 15 microbials and toxins in a single sample for applications such as infectious disease screening. The biochip will be operated without requiring any post-detection washing steps. This work is being performed in collaboration with our commercial partners at Raytheon ELCAN Optical Technologies in Richardson, Texas.",
        "techDescription": "RSI’s products are based upon guided-mode resonance (GMR) sensor technology that occurs in subwavelength waveguide-gratings. When these sensors are illuminated with a light source, a specific wavelength of light is reflected (with a corresponding transmission null) at a particular angle. Interaction of a target analyte with a biochemical layer on the sensor surface yields measurable angular shifts that directly identify the binding event without additional processing or foreign tags. The GMR sensor surface may be optimized with an array of capture molecules, allowing rapid detection of multiple analytes in a single test."

",
        "techDescription": "The system is a portable, multi-species gaseous detection unit based on differential ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy in combination with an advanced signal processing routine to identify species. The species enter the system through an air inlet in to a cell to allow multiple passes through the air sample. UV light spanning a broad range of wavelengths, traverses a heavily folded optical path (White cell) to allow for a long interaction length in a compact form factor. Gases within the path absorb the UV light; this absorption is registered in real time by the detector. Each constituent gas absorbs a unique fingerprint; the robust algorithm dynamically unmerges overlapping signals from multiple gases, to analyze each component simultaneously. This high throughput is advantageous for analyzing many samples in a short period of time or the ability to sweep vast areas in a short amount of time. <br />The system features parts per billion simultaneous detection and qualification capability. It measures several gases directly and with much faster time resolution than conventional methods.

        "Description": "The dotLab® mX System was designed for laboratory analysis. It uses a novel, flow based Diffractive Optics Technology (dot®) to combine multiplex immunoassay formats with real time measurements into protein interactions. The result is a highly flexible, easy to use and low cost platform that can provide more informative immunoassays compared to traditional end-point techniques. Together these features are designed to address the growing needs of biomedical researchers for running routine, multiplex assays on a variety of crude biological samples, including serum/plasma, whole blood, stool filtrate, cell/tissue/plant extracts and urine. With the dotLab® mX System, researchers will have the abilities to qualify reagents during immunoassay development, develop novel diagnostic tests, or investigate disease biomarkers for potential clinical applications – easily and quickly on a single platform. <br />One of the key applications for the dotLab® mX System is the development of rapid diagnostic tests for infectious diseases which can be performed at the point of testing (eg. local clinic or laboratory) instead at central laboratories far away from the infected patient or sample. The System is also well adapted to analyze fresh samples as they are acquired instead of requiring an accumulation of samples before testing is performed in order to be labor and cost effective. Another unique feature of the System is its ability to analyze intact bacterial and viral pathogens thereby eliminating the need for laborious and time consuming sample preparations.",
        "techDescription": "Diffractive optics technology combines grating-based light diffraction and immobilized capture surfaces. This produces a sensitive and simple technique for the detection of molecular binding and dissociation events without the use of fluorescent labels. Capture molecules, such as antibodies, are immobilized on an ordered pattern of lines that form a diffraction grating on the surface of the prism-shaped dotLab® Sensor. A series of diffraction beams are generated when the patterned molecules are illuminated with a laser. Binding of biomolecules, such as an antigen, to the patterned capture molecules increases the height of the surface pattern, producing an increased phase shift in the reflected beams, which in turn increases diffraction signal intensity that is detected in real time by a photodiode detector below the sensor. Since the illumination occurs through an integrated optical prism, the laser beam does not pass though the bulk solution in the flow channel. This significantly reduces the effects of sample refractive index and color on signal intensity which allows for the direct analysis of crude biological samples or for vigorous mixing of samples over the optical sensor. Its picomolar sensitivity and extended dynamic range of detection (> 7 logs) enable the analysis of both high and low abundance analytes without the need to perform sample dilutions. Finally, multiplex optical sensors have been created that can be customized by the user to analyze a multiple of biomarkers of there choice."

        "techDescription": "Infrared (IR) spectroscopy can be used to interrogate the structures of molecules by measuring the resonant frequencies of vibrational modes within the molecule. These frequencies are identified by measuring the transmission of IR light through a sample. Those vibrational modes that can experience a change in dipole moment upon the absorption of IR light will be IR active and will produce a peak in the IR spectrum. Therefore, molecules that contain highly polar chemical bonds, such as water (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and acetone ((CH3)2CO)), will produce strong IR spectra. Notably, linear diatomic molecules, such as nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), and hydrogen (H2), have no transition dipole moment and thus, do not absorb IR light and do not interfere with the IR measurement of other components of air samples."

The mixture separates into individual chemical components that travel at different speeds based on their unique properties. Once the mixture is separated into individual chemical components, each chemical molecule is detected by the mass spectrometer where they are blasted with a beam of electrons causing them to break apart. The chemical fragments create a unique chemical fingerprint called a mass spectrum. This mass spectrum is processed by the operating software and is automatically compared to a library of known chemicals. Once the system finds a match, it reports a confirmatory identification of each of the component found in the sample mixture."

The Griffin 824 mass spectrometer offers ease of adoption across a broad range of existing and emerging trace detection applications. Selectable detection modes allow customers to tailor the system to their operations using explosives only, narcotics only, or explosives/narcotics simultaneous mode. Operators collect trace residue by wiping personal belongings, skin, parcels/cargo, and other surfaces with a sample ticket. The sample ticket is inserted into the Griffin 824 sample inlet where analysis is performed via MS in less than 10 seconds. The Griffin 824 was designed to maximize system operational time by incorporating an open loop that does not recycle air inside the system. No cleaners are required, minimizing consumable costs and allowing rapid clear down after a true alarm.",
        "techDescription": "Utilizing lab-caliber mass spectrometry, the Griffin 824 performs rapid analysis and explosives/narcotics threat identification. A mass spectrometer measures a physio-chemical characteristic: the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of an ion. Thus, it provides more information about the chemical make-up of a sample than most other sensor technologies can detect. Mass spectrometry is also a very selective technology. Within one complex sample, multiple chemicals can be separated out and identified, even those that are very similar in chemical structure. Mass spectrometers use library matching algorithms to identify the various chemical components within a sample. Griffin 824 is supplied with Griffin-developed spectral libraries that include a broad range of military, commercial, and home-made explosives (includes peroxide-based explosives) that meet current threats and a broad range of commonly abused narcotics and controlled substances.

        "techDescription": "Air particles are pulled into the sensor by means of a diaphragm pump at 4 liters/minute. The particles pass through an optical illumination region where they are excited by a continuous-wave laser diode. Light emitted from these particles is scattered elastically (no change in wavelength) and may also emit fluorescence if biological material is present. In the IBAC, the elastically scattered light and the auto-fluorescence produced light are observed simultaneously on independent optical channels. <br />Once per second, the IBAC measures an environment’s particle counts, fluorescence, and particle size information. To trigger an alarm, the real-time detection algorithm analyzes changes in background particle activity. This rolling-average algorithm operates unattended and can trigger an alarm within 30 seconds of detecting a biological agent. Separate algorithm settings have been developed for indoor and outdoor use. All of the processing is performed within the sensor without the need for an attached computer. All acquired data may optionally be stored on an internal flash memory card for retrieval and analysis."

        "techDescription": "The detection principle consists in accelerating traditional immuno-agglutination on antibody-grafted microbeads by using magnetic Brownian colloids. These microbeads have self-organization properties under a homogenous magnetic field: they self-assemble into linear chains, and the resulting one-dimensional confinement drastically speed-up the recognition rate between the grafted antibodies and the antigen (Baudry et al.. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Oct 31;103(44):16076-8). The agglutination process can be monitored by the variation of the Optical Density after magnetic field application to the sample: this measurement relies on the fact that a doublet of microbeads scatters more light than two separate beads."

        "Description": "The LaserScan Analyzer is a handheld, battery-operated device that is capable of detecting surface contamination, due to the presence of chemical threats, within seconds and in a standoff mode. The system utilizes Quantum Cascade Lasers (QCLs) with the widest tuning range available today, covering the 6-12 microns infrared spectrum, and offers the chemical identification through the use of infrared spectroscopy. The current device, developed under funding from JIEDDO, Army SBIR and Congressional Adds, is capable of detecting trace explosives in the 1-10 micrograms/sq. cm from approximately 6-12 inches standoff distance. Longer distances could also be achieved with properly sized optics. The system has built-in libraries to detect and identify the explosives of interest and has been tested with numerous backgrounds and surfaces. A built-in LCD displays the identified chemical as well as the actual infrared spectrum, if needed. Furthermore, the same device, but with a different software package could be used for the detection of Chemical Warfare Agents (CWAs) and Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs) as Low Volatility Contaminants on surfaces. The system is currently at TRL6 or TRL7 levels. Alternative configurations include built-in gas and vapor detection capability, enabling the potential for LaserScan to detect both surface contaminations in standoff, as well as gases and vapors by collecting air samples. Infrared spectroscopy is also capable of detecting pathogens and other biological threats and feasibility has been demonstrated by several groups. LaserScan could potentially be able to identify such threats by developing appropriately prepared samples and software algorithms.",
        "techDescription": "The technology behind the operation of the LaserScan Analyzer is laser-based infrared spectroscopy. A Quantum Cascade Laser (QCL) in an External Cavity Configuration is used to tune across the infrared spectrum of 6-12 microns within a few seconds. A built-in infrared detector is used to collect the reflection of the infrared laser light as it bounces off the target and sophisticated, built-in, ultra-fast electronics generate an infrared spectrum of the chemical substance that was found on the target. High-speed, embedded software algorithms compare this spectrum to built-in infrared libraries and provide real-time identification of the chemical."

When these electrons go back to their standard energy levels, they emit the consequent energy by emission of a photon (light). MAB immediately detects and analyses this light. This is the way MAB detects and calculates all particles containing the precise ratio of components, this being a signature for biological particles. <br />This technology (FPD) is sensitive, reliable, not sensitive to humidity, temperature or mixture of compounds. MAB requires no service and nearly no maintenance. MAB remains operational after a positive detection. MAB offers the most reliable information on the field, not being lured by fluorescent or same size particles, with the best on field reliability."

The Military Water Safety Test System has a 3 Vial capacity for faster thru-put and easy comparison sample to calibration standard or to background. This is an all-in-one unit thus enhancing portability. <br />End Users: U.S. military drinking water quality units, state and federal health agencies, small labs.",
        "techDescription": "The Military Water Safety Test System accurately quantitatively measures all Beta emitters, including Tritium below 10,000pC/L andCarbon-14 and low energy Gamma and Alpha emitters. The most sensitive method of detecting and quantitating beta emitting isotopes is to mix the sample with liquid scintillation fluor and count each individual scintillation event with a photomultplier counter. Scintillation counts detected by PM tubes are processed by a fully adjustable single channel analyzer centered on the energy peak of the isotope being measured. Followed by an energy analyzer which further selects the pulses and delivers the true signal. Detection cell optically coupled to selected photomultiplier tube. A 3 Vial capacity provides a faster thru-put and easy comparison sample to calibration standard or to background. <br />The Military Water Safety Test System deletes both higher energy pulses from background radiation and lower energy counts from the PM tube or circuit noise. The pulses are then fed to a digital scaler and optional digital printer. (Thus allowing long count times for measurement of very minute samples as well as completely eliminating artifacts caused by rate meter time constants.) Optional USB interface to most scientific or personal computers or data stations."

        "Description": "MINICAMS® is a fully automated, continuous, near-real-time air monitoring system. It was designed primarily for use in the U.S. Army's Chemical Stockpile Disposal Program as an automated chemical-vapor alarm system for monitoring of workplace air and other potentially contaminated in-plant zones, e.g., stack exhausts, ducts, filter banks, etc. It also works well for support of materials-penetration and permeation studies and many other laboratory or on-site test efforts involving a need to detect and quantify chemical vapors automatically and continuously. It provides audible, visible, and electrical alarm responses to toxic military chemical agent vapors, e.g., GB, VX, HD, etc., and to many other substances at any of a variety of regulatory threshold concentrations, e.g., TWA, MDL, PEL, etc. It also provides accurate vapor concentration readings at concentrations in the general vicinity of the preset alarm threshold. It was specifically designed to detect and accurately quantify the chemical agents and other volatile and semi-volatile compounds at far lower concentrations than most other chemical vapor monitors. MINICAMS is a readily transportable system that is designed to be set up and operated at fixed indoor locations or (under mild conditions) at sheltered outdoor monitoring stations, although instances of successful use in vehicles and other mobile platforms have occurred. It requires one or more compressed gases and a source of 117VAC electrical power for its operation.",
        "techDescription": "MINICAMS® is based on collection of airborne chemical vapors on a solid sorbent or in a sample loop, thermal desorption or flushing of the collected vapors into a gas chromatographic (GC) column, separation of the sample constituents on the column, and detection by a sensitive GC detector. The available GC detectors include both universal (i.e., nonselective) detector types that respond indiscriminately to virtually all substances, and selective detectors that respond primarily to certain restricted classes of chemicals. The instrument cycles repetitively through a Sample Period, during which an air sample is accumulated, and a subsequent Purge Period, during which the collected sample constituents are separated, detected, and quantified. Total instrument cycle times can range from about 5 min to 20 min or more. When a selective detector is installed, MINICAMS delivers accurate quantification and detection limits in the parts-per-billion and/or parts-per-quadrillion range as a matter of routine, although the system can be reconfigured or detuned to cover almost any desired concentration range above these levels."

After completion of this two-year program, three prototypes have been developed. The wireless, electronic, chemical biological agent detector is very small (35mm x 85mm x 105mm) and weighs less than 400 grams. The Morphix chem/bio detector is easy to use. Simply insert the colorimetric coupon coated with chemical formulations specific for classes of chemical and biological agents, into the Morphix chem/bio detector and turn the unit on. Optoelectronic sensing of the coupon occurs at a predetermined rate. Upon detection of a color change on the coupon, the results are communicated wirelessly. The modular net-centric wireless communication technology is adaptable to multiple communication protocols. The modularity of this device makes it adaptable to many applications including as a personal detection badge, perimeter detection, standoff detection and mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle or unmanned ground vehicle. Given it is the only known device capable of detecting both chemical and biological threats in such a compact package, the Morphix chem/bio detector is an excellent screening tool. This device has broad applicability within the military and first responder communities. The wireless, electronic, chemical, biological agent detection module provides broad chemical and biological agent class detection with significantly smaller size, weight, cost, training requirements and power requirements than current technologies.",

        "Description": "The Cartridge Reader system uses MSD’s MULTI-ARRAY® electrochemiluminescence (ECL) technology to enable highly sensitive multiplexed immunoassay measurements in a compact, fully-automated format. The Cartridge Reader system consists of a compact reader instrument (12.5 lbs., 9” H x 8” W x 14” D) and single-use disposable cartridges that can conduct multiplexed measurements of up to 20 targets or controls per sample. The cartridges include integrated microfluidics to allow for fully automated sample processing and analysis without user intervention. Two cartridges types are available: one for analyzing liquid samples and the other for swab samples. To run an assay, the sample (liquid or swab) is inserted into the appropriate cartridge and the cartridge is then capped and loaded into the reader. All subsequent processing steps, including swab extraction (swab cartridge) and multiplexed ECL detection are fully automated. The system can detect and measure bacteria, viruses, and toxins with limits of detection many times lower than lateral flow immunoassays. The system is extremely simple to operate and provides a result in about 15 minutes. The Cartridge Reader system is still under development for laboratory and point-of-care clinical and environmental testing applications and is not yet commercially released. However, the instrument has been tested at DoD technology readiness evaluations (TREs) and has been through clinical evaluations in the U.S. and other locations worldwide for influenza diagnostics.",
        "techDescription": "MSD’s PR2 and Cartridge Reader instruments employ MSD’s MULTI-ARRAY® technology that combines electrochemiluminescence (ECL) detection and array-based multiplexed measurements. ECL immunoassays enable highly sensitive measurement of samples for the presence of bacteria, viruses, and toxins. The measurements are performed on arrays printed on carbon ink electrodes that are incorporated into multi-well assay plates and cartridges. MULTI-ARRAY technology consistently has been demonstrated to provide high performance measurement capability in a wide range of matrices and in the presence of many interferents. While MULTI-ARRAY technology is primarily used for immunoassays, the technology can also be used for multiplexed nucleic acid measurements."

Thus we have a rapid, point-of-care bacteria detection system that only detects live bacteria. The test system is portable and can be taken into the field for monitoring of bacteria and easily used by non-laboratory personnel. Test time is under one minute. Detection limits go down to 100 CFU. The product is commercial and currently is used for bacteria detection in healthcare, food and water applications. ",
        "techDescription": "This kit detects the presence of living bacterial cells by measuring the amount of ATP in the sample. ATP is a cellular metabolite present in all living cells; the amount of ATP in a sample is proportional to the number of living cells. The test can distinguish bacteria from human cells through the use of sample preparation methods that release ATP selectively from microbial cells. The system has two main components: a microluminometer to read ATP-induced luminescence and a Filtravette (a filter device and cuvette combined) to concentrate cells from a sample solution and remove chemical contaminants. Samples and solutions are processed through the filtravette using an empty syringe. After the sample is processed, a solution is applied to remove non-microbial sources of ATP. Then a microbial lysis solution is added to the filtravette followed by a luciferase solution that produces light in the presence of ATP. After pipette mixing, the filtravette is placed in the reader and the intensity of emitted light (luminescence) is recorded."

        "Description": "The NIDS® ACE Test is an in vitro analytical test for the rapid qualitative detection of acetylcholinesterase-inhibiting pesticides, nerve agents, and heavy metals in water and food. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that stimulates muscle contraction. In humans and other vertebrates, Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is the enzyme that hydrolyzes acetylcholine, thereby regulating its levels. When AChE is inhibited, the excess acetylcholine causes the nervous system to lose control over the muscular system, resulting in convulsions, asphyxia, heart arrest, and death. Many pesticides, such as organophosphates, carbamates, and chemical warfare nerve agents, are AChE inhibitors. These classes of contaminants may be present in drinking water as the result of farm irrigation run-off where pesticides have been used or possibly by the intentional contamination of water by terrorist groups. The ACE Test is a quick method for the determination of possible water contamination by these classes of contaminants.",
        "techDescription": "The NIDS® ACE Test is based on the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and other enzymes by pesticides and neurotoxins. Two different enzymes are used, Reagent A and Reagent B. Reagents A and B contain enzymes which have different reactivities with different acetylcholinesterase-inhibiting compounds. The reagents are lyophilized to ensure long term stability. A sample of water is introduced into a vial of Reagent A and Reagent B. A negative control composed of purified water is introduced into similar vials of Reagent A and Reagent B. The vials are mixed and allowed to react with any compounds present in the water. Acetylcholinesterase-inhibiting compounds in the water will deactivate one or both of the lyophilized enzymes. The negative control, which does not contain acetylcholinesterase inhibiting compounds, will not be deactivated. Samples from the test and control vials are introduced into designated wells on test tickets which contain filter pads that have been treated with a fluorescent substrate. The sample and control are allowed to react with the fluorescent substrate and then the level of fluorescent product in each well is measured by a reader. If the test sample contains acetylcholinesterase-inhibiting compounds, then the level of fluorescence in the test well will be significantly lower than in the control well in one or both of the tests."

        "techDescription": "The dosimeter measures personal dose equivalent and personal dose equivalent rate of both gamma and X-ray radiation in a wide range. The functionality of the device based on the principle that some materials (radiation detectors) can register and detect gamma radiation. Production technology utilizes Geiger-Muller counters. Geiger-Muller counter utilizes small metal tubes filled with inert gas. When gas molecules inside the tube are excited by the incident radiation, they create an electrical current for the readout. The magnitude of the current is proportional to the energy of an incident photons and therefore of dose of incident radiation."

The technology that resulted from this program is widely held to be a major DARPA success story and the fundamentals of the technology and its validation have been documented in peer-reviewed publications. <br />The Ibis Technology (now commercially available as the PLEX-ID) represents a universal pathogen detection platform capable of identification and strain typing of a broad range of pathogens. The platform employs the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) with primers that amplify relatively conserved regions of the genome(s) present in a sample. Using high-performance electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), the base composition (i.e., the number of A’s, G’s, C’s, and T’s) of each amplicon is determined and the combination of base compositions from multiple primer pairs is assembled to yield the identity of the organism (s) in the sample. The platform has far-reaching applications in areas such as food safety, biological products screening, and clinical diagnostics. Initial deployments are for the purpose of identification and strain-typing of pathogens associated with biowarfare/bioterrorism events and naturally occurring emerging infectious disease.",
        "techDescription": "In each PCR/ESI-MS assay, multiple pairs of primers are used to amplify carefully selected regions of pathogen genomes; the primer target sites are broadly conserved, but the amplified region carries information on the microbe’s identity in its unique nucleotide base composition. Regions of this nature appear in the DNA that encodes ribosomal RNA and in housekeeping genes that encode essential proteins. Following PCR amplification, a fully automated ESI-MS analysis is performed. This PCR/ESI-MS technology has been successfully used to identify pathogenic bacteria and viruses from a variety of clinical and environmental samples."

Integrated positive and negative control electrodes allow normalization of target electrode signals. This ensures reproducibility of electrochemical toxin detection within different chip batches. The pTD is a platform technology and extendable to address new threats.

The NQAD line of detectors utilizes water condensation nucleation technology which does not rely on a specific characteristic of the compound to be detected. The detector first nebulizes the HPLC stream then, second, evaporates the mobile phase leaving a dried aerosol particle. Third, water is condensed on the particle to increase its size. Only then is each particle individually counted. At a basic level, the NQAD is a particle counter that works well as a mass counter as well. With a strong separation method, the NQADs high sensitivity, linearity, wide dynamic range and high reproducibility lead to nanogram on column sensitivity. Detection does not rely on a specific characteristic of the compound; therefore, no derivatization is needed. The detector works well with gradient methods, mobile phases of any pH, is linear over 3-4 orders of magnitude and displays a peak reading in real time.",
        "techDescription": "The Quant line of NQAD detectors utilizes “Water Condensation Nucleation” technology. This technology has been used in air particle analyzers, which are generally used for clean room analysis and environmental monitoring. In addition, it has been used as a nonvolatile residue monitor that tests the amount of nonvolatile residue in ultrapure water system (crucial in the semiconductor industry). The NQAD line of detectors was created by taking this robust technology and applying it to chromatography."

        "Description": "The aftermath of the Fukushima Daaichi disaster in Japan exposed two major flaws in the radiation detection technology industry: <ul><li>1. The industry could not ramp up production fast enough to meet the demand for radiation detection systems from customers in Japan.</li><li>2. The systems were designed for use by first responders and nuclear industry professionals and not everyday users.</li>Universal Detection Technology, through a partnership with Honeywell International and Hamamatsu has set out to design a first of its kind smartphone compatible survey meter. The unique feature of this survey meter is that the device will measure elevated levels of gamma radiation and transmit that data to a Bluetooth-ready smartphone. The dedicated smartphone app in development by Universal Detection Technology will give the user the ability to use simple menu-driven features to test for radiation in food, surfaces or clothing and subsequently share the accumulated data with other users through mapping and social networking features. <br />User’s will also have the option to share and store readings on a safe and secure cloud which they have access to at anyplace at any time. Additional features will allow the user to: visually analyze data, keep track of cumulative dose, set automatic alerts (email, SMS, and other) and export data in different formats with timestamps and geo-tags. <br />The device will be easy enough to use for the everyday user but also sophisticated enough for the first responder market.",

MOVe valves can be opened or closed by applying a vacuum or pressure to an air chamber formed by a flexible membrane layer. By combining three or more valves, on-chip MOVe diaphragm micropumps can be formed to transport and process samples. These micropumps control fluidic flow, can readily manipulate volumes from 20 nL to 100 µL, and are excellent in handling paramagnetic beads. MOVe routers can be made from four or more valves to rapidly and effectively mix two nanofluidic streams in seconds, a feature that has been elusive in microfluidics. The second key IntegenX technological breakthrough has been the adaptation of paramagnetic bead technology to work with large volume, “real world” samples, and collapse the targeted contents to a scale suitable for integration with downstream microfluidic devices. A novel feature of the MOVe pumps is their ability to move and capture beads which is not straightforward in other microfluidics devices. The third kety IntegenX technology is DevLink?? software. DevLink is a robust, industrial-strength, distributed instrumentation control platform with an object-oriented application architecture implemented in C# using Microsoft’s .NET Framework. DevLink defines a set of communication and command protocols within a standardized automation architecture. As a result, DevLink forms the basis for both internal breadboard-system development as well as commercial product releases at IntegenX."

This advanced system has automated sample preparation, detects with high sensitivity, and identifies with high accuracy up to 20 different pathogens at once. Detected threats include toxins, DNA viruses, RNA viruses, bacteria, and bacterial spores. The RapidPlex identifier is capable of detecting at least 10-20 threat targets in a single test and utilizes multiple (2-3) independent biomarkers per threat target to ensure high levels of detection confidence and to minimize false positives, especially from non-pathogenic near-neighbors that are often present in the environment. The analyzer’s total analysis time is configurable dependent on sensitivity requirements, but in its most sensitive mode, provides sample-to-answer times of less than 30 minutes. RapidPlex was developed initially for unattended environmental monitoring, but is adaptable to other biodetection applications such as clinical diagnostics and food/water testing.",
        "techDescription": "RapidPlex employs fast multiplex PCR to amplify DNA and RNA target sequences and a rapid multiplexed antibody sandwich assay for detection of toxins and surface proteins on viruses and bacteria. DNA amplicons and protein targets are detected by capturing them with specific capture probes on tens of thousands of microbeads. Each microbead is color coded to identify which threat hypothesis is being tested. This fluorescent imaging readout of thousands of assay microbeads enables coverage of a long threat list without the loss of sensitivity associated with sample splitting. The analyzer uses multiple molecular markers per threat to reduce false positives."

        "Description": "This rapid, automatic fluorometric assay system is a portable (6.45 kg) 4-channel system for monitoring toxins, viruses, bacteria, spores, fungi and other diverse targets. An extremely reliable third-generation product introduced in 2000, users have found these instruments will operate for two years or more with no breakdowns or leaks, and that they will tolerate debris-laden samples (such as are produced in mailrooms and food processing facilities) - impressive feats for a fully automated wet assay system. Although designed for the military, it works well in the laboratory too.<br />The completely self-contained instrument is the culmination of a careful integration of optics, fluidics, electronics, and software into one compact system for laboratory and field assays. It performs user-defined, multi-step, assay protocols for monitoring fluorescently-labeled immunoassays occurring on the surface of each of the system's four disposable optical waveguide sensors. Toxins and bacteria such as ricin and B. anthracis have been detected at levels below <1.0 ng/ml and 100 CFU/ml, respectively. <br />Four sensors are mounted in a disposable plastic coupon allowing four different pathogens to be detected in a sample; or multiple channels may target the same pathogen to improve statistical certainty. Each coupon may be used for up to 30 assays if negative results are obtained. A bar code on each coupon identifies the type of assay to be run by the instrument and allows very sophisticated assays to be performed by unskilled persons. A computer embedded within the RAPTOR™ performs and controls all steps in the assay procedure.",
        "techDescription": "Research International's Raptor bio-identifier system is based on 'sandwich format' fluoroimmunoassay reactions taking place on the surface of injection molded polystyrene waveguides. All fluidic and optoelectronic steps associated with the assay are performed automatically. In a typical waveguide-based sandwich immunoassay, the waveguide has a monolayer of capture antibody immobilized on its surface. The waveguide is first incubated with sample, washed, then incubated with fluorophore-labeled antibody to form an antibody/antigen/labeled-antibody sandwich. Excitation light is injected into the waveguide and fluorescence emission is collected by a sensitive photodetector that looks down the waveguide axis. The four waveguides are mounted in a small ‘coupon’ that contains a bar code identifier. The onboard computer reads the bar code and automatically performs the proper assay protocol. All reagents and wastes are contained in the portable unit."

        "Description": "The Resource Effective BioIdentification System (REBS) -Laboratory Variant is a microbial identification technology that enumerates and identifies microbes using a combination of microscopic imaging and Raman microspectroscopy. The measurement process begins when the system collects particulate material on a solid substrate within a defined region. Next, using standard microscopy techniques, the collected material is imaged at a high magnification, and each field of view is recorded and indexed as the macroscopic collection region is scanned. This iterative process continues until the entire collected region has been scanned. From these images, all particles are located automatically by image processing algorithms, and their morphological properties are used as a first test to discriminate biological particles from non-biological particles. The collection substrate is then moved to bring each particle directly below the microscope objective in order to measure its Raman spectrum. This spectral signature provides accurate discrimination of biological particles from non-biological particles. Moreover, the particle can be identified by matching the measured spectrum to a database of spectra for known materials. Identification is supported only if spectral signatures of the material are available in the spectral database.",

The equipment continuously analyses the absorption of the scene compared with the background.

Second Sight® operates in band III, in order to use the particular lines which enable them to be identified from several gases. The Second Sight® allows real time visualization of gas cloud: the image processing algorithms highlights the presence of a gas cloud on the targeted line. The evaluation of the quantity of gas is carried out by a three differential infra-red imaging process: spatial, spectral, and temporal fields. Spectral differentiation exploits the spectral nature of the gas, which is isolated through the successive utilization of several filters. The comparison of channels enables a value corresponding to the gas cloud concentration. In particular, spatial differentiation enables the luminescence of the gas cloud to be eliminated and to only take its transmission into account. This characteristic enables Second Sight® to detect the gas even when it is at an ambient temperature."

Both sensors (SIRAD/diacetylene and TLD/lithium fluoride chip) are tissue equivalent, light, rugged, can be carried 24/7, affordable and do not need a power source. The TLD-dosimeter can be reused many times and can be assigned to the user for a life time. <br />Highly sensitive lithium fluoride (LiF) TLD sensors (LiF:Cu,Mg,P or LiF:Cu,Na,Si) are used for SIRAD-TLD as they do not require metal filters for energy corrections. The TLD materials have a negligible effect of ambient conditions and an almost linear response with energy & dose. The TLD-sensor is very sensitive (LLD = 10 micro Sievert/0.01 mSv), the most widely used worldwide and a field proven technology over several decades. TLD readers and certified facilities to the dose are available worldwide for reading the dose. <br />The SIRAD and TLD sensors are small, pre-calibrated, rugged, sealed against moisture and contamination and further protected from ambient conditions in the pocket of the card.

Unlike most existing diagnostic detection techniques which are based on optical detection methods that require pure samples and multiple processing steps, T2’s technology is not optical and therefore does not require purification of biological samples. This significant advantage allows the T2 system to perform single-step processing and rapid turnaround times without the need for trained technicians. Furthermore, the technology can accurately identify almost any specimen, including proteins, nucleic acids, or enzymes; bacterial, cancer or other cells; viruses; or small molecule drug compounds within almost any sample, including whole blood, plasma, serum and urine. T2’s system is faster, more reliable, more portable and more readily accessible than any diagnostic testing system now on the market.",

        "Description": "TacBio was developed by the U.S. government for military, homeland security, and public health applications. It is a compact and rugged portable biological particle detector that uses both diffractive scattering and natural biological fluorescence to monitor aerosol particulates and classify them as being of either biological or non-biological origin. Research International Inc. is an official licensee of the U.S. government for the TacBio, and has the right to manufacture and sell the instrument worldwide.<br />The TacBio is extremely useful for tracking background levels of airborne non-biological and biological materials and providing an alarm and/or digital activation command to other equipment if there is a rapid increase in the aerosol background. It cannot identify the type of biological material detected, and for that reason it is correctly characterized as an aerosol ‘trigger.’ <br />The TacBio requires little maintenance and no consumables, and is an ideal first line of defense for monitoring areas that cannot be accessed regularly or must be monitored discretely. Since no consumables are used, operating time in the field is limited only by the availability of electric power. The device accepts a range of primary and rechargeable long-lived batteries that provide in excess of 24 hours continuous operation. Additionally, there is no difficulty operating at sub-zero temperatures since no liquid-based media are required. Operation may be monitored remotely using Windows-based software provided with the unit, and changes made to its operating characteristics as needed or desired.",
        "techDescription": "TacBio operation is based on the fact that aerosolized biological materials fluoresce, in addition to scattering light when irradiated by UV light, in this case from a long-lived LED. Fluorescence emission and photon scattering events are measured with a unique “Geiger counter” high-speed photon counting method and analyzed by software to create a snapshot every 60 seconds of biological and non-biological particulates present in sampled air. These aerosol statistics are stored in a 30 minute-long ‘History’ file. Every 60 seconds current particle statistics are compared with this moving baseline to determine if an unusual increase in particle concentration has occurred."

        "techDescription": "Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy FTIR is an absorption spectroscopy technique where an infrared light is passed through the sample. Some wavelengths may be absorbed, while others merely pass through the sample unaffected. Specific molecular bonds absorb a specific amount of energy and these losses of energy correspond to the peaks returned in an analysis. FTIR absorptions are strong and provide outstanding and easily interpretable results for substances which contain polar covalent bonds. FTIR spectroscopy is best used as a primary analysis technique for identifying colored substances such as industrial dyes, pigments and oils, and fluorescent materials."

        "techDescription": "TIRF Sense chem-bio sensor employs synergistic combination of Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) with Electric field Control (TIRF-EC). TIRF-EC sensor chip represents a glass or plastic slide coated with a thin electroconducting transparent layer of indium tin oxide (ITO). TIRF-EC chips are incorporated into cartridges that are available in disposable or reusable formats. TIRF-EC chip carries a microarray of reagentless bioassays printed on the ITO surface. TIRF-EC sensor cartridge is engaged into optical, fluidic, and electrochemical subsystems that allow for performing supersensitive TIRF-EC analysis. TIRF provides real-time monitoring of the interactions between target molecules and bioassays, while the electric field enables several advantageous functions in TIRF system, including accelerated transport of target molecules to their detection sites and discrimination between close homologs of target molecules. TIRF-EC microarrays detect unlabeled, unmodified targets. TIRF-EC microarray may contain from a few spots of bioassays in a single flow channel to hundreds of chem-bio assays in two or three separate flow channels. TIRF Sense supports fluorescence assays, Electro-Chemi-Luminescence (ECL), other luminescence assays, as well as luminescence assays immobilized in a hydrogel layer printed at the TIRF-EC surface. "

The instrument delivers exceptional threat discrimination and interference rejection using real-time processing of the data with advanced alarm algorithms. It has been tested with standard simulants for bio-threat agents (spore & vegetative bacteria, viruses and toxins), and has undergone significant field testing to verify its performance. The instrument is designed for field operation in terms of reliability, maintainability, and serviceability. (A predecessor instrument, the TSI UVAPS Model 3312A, has been fielded in the US Army P3I-BIDS enclosure.) The TSI FLAPS III™ Model 3317 system simultaneously measures for each individual airborne particle, the scattered-light intensity and the fluorescence emissions in two wavelength regions. These single particle measurements provide a robust data set for the rapid detection of airborne biological threat agents under various background environments. The instrument is generally used with a front-end aerosol concentrator to optimize performance, and is available in a stand-alone environmental enclosure with radio communications for remote operation. It has been in production since early 2004. The TSI FLAPS III™ Model 3317 is developed under sole license of U.S. patent numbers 5701012, 5895922 , and 6831279 from the Canadian Department of Defense.",
        "techDescription": "The detection of biological aerosols by the TSI FLAPS III™ Model 3317 is based on UV laser-induced fluorescence. The instrument uses a simplified optical train with a single, commercially available 405nm CW laser diode for both excitation and optical sizing (nominal lifetime of 10,000 hours of continuous operation). An opposed nozzle design, consisting of an inlet nozzle and an outlet nozzle, prevents particle recirculation in the optical chamber, and is used together with HEPA-filtered sheath air flow to eliminate fouling of the optical components. Measurements are taken on individual particles in the aerosol stream."

Functionalized, 130 angstrom diameter gold nano-probes (measured by static light scattering, 5 nm S.D.) also bind to the target through a molecular-scale complex containing antibodies. The target-bound molecular complex is then quantified through silver enhancement of the functionalized gold. Assays in this format can be rapidly configured and implemented for a wide array of potential biomarkers. For example we have demonstrated a robust and ultra-sensitive assay for cardiac troponin with an LOD of less than 500 femtograms per mL serum, and an overall CV of less than 20%. The assay also shows very low background, a broad dynamic range and over 3 logs of linear dose response."

The fluorescence generated is split into UV and visible bands and the intensity of each is measured. <br />The data from the aerosol measurements is passed to the VeroWarn software in which a suite of intelligent algorithms assess the probability that a biological challenge has been detected. The analysis algorithms can be adjusted to vary the response of the system for a range of operational requirements.

Our products include disposable sensor plates and associated benchtop reader systems that quantify biochemical reactions in real time with outstanding accuracy and repeatability. This differentiating technology provides new assay tools for laboratories that will dramatically reduce the labor time and cost of biochemical tests. The system is fully controlled through advanced software, which includes data analysis features to provide either kinetic or end-point information. Our sensor platform can be applied to monitor virtually any bio- or chemical reaction in a variety of matrices (including serum, environmental water samples, and food). Selectivity is imparted on the sensor element using conventional surface chemistries (such as silane) to covalently attach commercially available antibody, aptamer, or DNA selective layers. As a test begins, the analyte binds to the detection-layer target, and the system monitors instantaneous changes at the sensor surface. Test time is limited only by chemical binding dynamics, and is typically less than 15 minutes. Qualitative data is available immediately after sample introduction. The RSI sensor plates are readily adaptable to standard immunoassay, cell-based, DNA, or microbial testing methods. The sensors are integrated into standard microwell formats so that laboratories may still use existing automated sample handling equipment. RSI sensor plates are available in a variety of reactive surfaces (silane or custom). They may also be purchased pre-sensitized for specific assays, such as S. aureus, S. enterotoxin A and B, and others.",

When these sensors are illuminated with a broadband light source, a specific wavelength of light is reflected. Interaction of a target analyte with a biochemical layer on the sensor surface yields measurable spectral shifts that directly identify the binding event without additional processing or foreign tags. The GMR sensor surface may be optimized with an array of capture molecules, allowing rapid detection of multiple analytes in a variety of matrices."

The reaction products enter a downstream quadrupole where they are filtered again before being detected by a particle counter. The results are quantified in Real Time. The sytem can differentiate all isobars and some isomers, based on the use of the three precursor ions.Both SIM and Scan modes are possible and sytem can be operated by non-scientific operator."
